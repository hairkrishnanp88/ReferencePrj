Here password is encrypt and decrypt using the TripleDES Alogrithm. This method basically handle the request from the mobile UI and send those request to domain serivce and get the appropriate response from domian service and send to mobile UI. It is playing and intermediate role.

MYSPS Xamarin Application: It is develp using the Xamarin technology. This is and UI bascially, gather the response from the services and align those request in proper way. Can match the response using the model and view will display the content based on the commands. Viewmodel page can match exactly with the response.

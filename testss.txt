I am a reliance customer form past 5 years bought many products. Not faced damange issue this the first time I am facing. Please see the below description in detail
Note:"I have done all the prior steps before the damange calim date"
I have bought Samsung A70 mobile on "" and its unfortunately get damaged on
After 4 days (to understand the process) called to customer case they asked me to raise the request ()
I got call from customer support and they not able to hear my voice properly on first time and again call gets connected even that time also they said like "Didnt hear the voice properly" and suddenly they closed the request.
So again I have raised request they saimd me like you will get pick for your mobile . After waiting a long days , no pick has been arranged. After I went to reliance store "They said like here pick is not available".
Again got call from customer support "Pay amount 2999" bill has been attached with the mail. Even pick is not has been arranged.
So called to customer care "They asked me to surrender the mobile on the date of oct 5 2019". Job sheet has been attached. Still I am not getting the proper resonse from any of the team. 
I have struggle lot for this case. Yet didnt get any positive solution.
I request you to reopen the case and kindly do the needful
